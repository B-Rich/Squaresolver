# Squaresolver
Python algorithm that solves magic squares of n-dimensions using genetic algorithms 
Execute Main.py:
<br>
write "python Main.py arg1 args2 arg3" in console<br>
where args1 is the dimension of the magic square<br>
args2 is the population #<br>
and args 3 is the sample #<br>
the program automaticly shows you when it founds a solution.
